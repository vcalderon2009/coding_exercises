class Solution:

        """
        Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a
        point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points
        to the origin (0, 0).

        The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean
        distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

        You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed
        to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

        Steps
        --------------
        1.  Initialize a min heap
        2.  Push the elements one by one. Once the minHeap has reached
            'k' values, add the element and push the last element
        3.  Once all the elements have been passed through the min heap
            return the coordinates of the minHeap
